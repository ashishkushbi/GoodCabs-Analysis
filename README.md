**Introduction:**

Goodcabs, a cab service company established two years ago, has gained a strong foothold in the Indian market by focusing on tier-2 cities. 
Unlike other cab service providers, Goodcabs is committed to supporting local drivers, helping them make a sustainable living in their hometowns while ensuring excellent service to passengers.
With operations in ten tier-2 cities across India, Goodcabs has set ambitious performance targets for 2024 to drive growth and improve passenger satisfaction. 

### As part of this initiative, the Goodcabs management team aims to assess the companyâ€™s performance across key metrics, including -

Trip volume, 
Passenger satisfaction, 
Repeat passenger rate, 
Trip distribution, and 
Balance between new and repeat passengers.
